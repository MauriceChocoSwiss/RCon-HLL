# RCon-HLL
basic RCon for HLL with a better interface.
For better compatibility, it was build for x86. If it prompt to download .Net when lunch the soft, please select x86 of the runtime version. 

For the moment it's a mixed French/English. I'll change that in the future !

Some functionnalities was not implemented yet, please be patient !
